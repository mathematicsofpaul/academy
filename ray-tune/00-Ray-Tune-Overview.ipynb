    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial, part of [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy), introduces _hyperparameter tuning_, often called _hyperparameter optimization_ for which we'll use the acronym _HPO_ (since \"hyperparameter\" is often spelled \"hyper parameter\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular this tutorial introduces [Ray Tune](http://tune.io), Ray's comprehensive HPO library.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ray Tune](../images/RayTune.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a lesson on the new [Ray SGD](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/raysgd/raysgd.html) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ray SGD](../images/RaySGD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the instructions in the [README](../README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go [here](../Overview.ipynb) for an overview of all tutorials."
