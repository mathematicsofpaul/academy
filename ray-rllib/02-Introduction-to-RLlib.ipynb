    "\n",
    "Here is a fast introduction to using RLlib from a command line, adapted from the [documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html#rllib-in-60-seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "First you would install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), whichever you prefer.  Then install RLlib. **All of these items are already installed in this tutorial environment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install ray[rllib]  # or consider using: ray[debug]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then **train** `CartPole` using _PPO_ with the `rllib` CLI. We connect to the running Ray cluster, we'll stop at 20 iterations, and we'll save checkpoints every 10 iterations and at the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "rllib train --run PPO --env CartPole-v1 --stop='{\"training_iteration\": 20}' --ray-address auto --checkpoint-freq 10 --checkpoint-at-end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `rllib` CLI has a `--help` flag that prints details about the supported options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "rllib --help          # general help\n",
    "rllib train --help    # specific help on the training options\n",
    "rllib rollout --help  # specific help on the rollout options\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "_Rollout_ means running an episode with the trained model, which you specify by passing a checkpoint directory to the command. During rollout a continuous loop of taking an action and observing the new state and reward continues until some final state or number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute the same training logic using the following Python code, which leverages [Ray Tune](http://tune.io), specifically the [tune.run](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api_docs/execution.html#tune-run) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ray import tune\n",
    "from ray.rllib.agents.ppo import PPOTrainer\n",
    "tune.run(PPOTrainer, \n",
    "    config={\"env\": \"CartPole-v1\"},\n",
    "    stop={\"training_iteration\": 20},\n",
    "    checkpoint_at_end=True,\n",
    "    verbose=2            # 2 for INFO; change to 1 or 0 to reduce the output.\n",
